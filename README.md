## GraphQL-API-with-Apollo-Server-and-Node-Express Js

This is a simple project to setup a GraphQL server and create endpoints using Apollo Server with Node/Express JS. In this example, I have used it as a middlware and combined GraphQL with existing REST framework.

## Functionalities

1. Integration of Apollo Server into existing node-express-mongo based REST application
2. Schema definition for GraphQL Queries and Mutations

- Query to fetch posts
- Query to fetch a single post by id
- Mutation to create a post
- Mutation to update a post
- Mutation to delete a post

3. Resolver functions for the above queries and mutations
